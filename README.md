## Features And Benefits

1.  Mobile app experience for both users and drivers so two mobile apps powered by the blockchain 

2. ICP Oracle Feature to calcuate the emission factor and footprint saved using metrics from APIS the following below and get our carbon footprint saved

    
+ Transportation Data:


    Google Maps Distance Matrix API: Provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations. Documentation: Google Maps Distance Matrix API
    
   
+ Energy Consumption & Carbon Intensity (Africa):


    ElectricityMap API: Provides live electricity data and carbon intensity for different regions, including Africa.

+ Vehicle Emissions Factors:


    UK Government Vehicle Emissions API: Provides emissions factors for various types of vehicles, typically used in the UK but useful for emissions estimates.


+ Carbon Pricing Data:

    EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): Provides carbon pricing and trading data for emissions within the EU.

+ Sustainability Metrics:



    Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) API: Provides access to corporate environmental data, including sustainability metrics and carbon disclosures.




3. Graph Protocol 
- Graph Protocol for Analytics to Produce Research Papaer on how we have improved the emission rate for a greener Earth. 
- Drivers get analtytics on the chart with non opinionated queries



4. Base Blockchain Network 
 - Use of Base for Cheap Transactions on the Public Ledger














## Subgraph queries
